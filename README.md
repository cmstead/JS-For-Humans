# JS For Humans #

Programming is, inherently, a human endeavor.  We write programs for people. We work with other people. Even our source code is for people! (Since computers deal in bit-flipping, humans are the only people who care what's in the source code.)

JavaScript is a language devised for the web to help people connect with others through interactions in the browser.  It has since moved outside of the browser and is ubiquitous in the development world, having become one of the most commonly used languages, sharing the top with the likes of Java, Python, C++, and C# (According to GitHub as of late 2018/early 2019).

It is high time we start talking about the ways we work to make our JS code helpful to, useful for, readable by, and maintainable by humans.

This repository will likely change over time, but my immediate goal is to capture information from the (https://gitter.im/JS-For-Humans)[JS For Humans Gitter Community] and share it in a stable, easy to consume format.

Pull requests are welcome and contributions are vital!
